# Digital Twin Basics
For my project for Northeastern's CS4300 Computer Graphics with Professor Shah, I built a basic robot simulator which parses a URDF file and can perform forward kinematics to control the joints of the robot.
## build and run
To build the library with an up-to-date Rust toolchain:
> cargo build

To run:
> cargo run --example=urdf_parse
